
Nvidia Driver
1) pre install
-install gcc:
-install driver (NVIDIA doesn't support ubuntu 18.04 so this is custom):
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:graphics-drivers/ppa
sudo apt install nvidia-driver-396
- install cuda toolkit:
cuda deps:
sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev libxi-dev libxmu-dev
base: wget https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/9.2/Prod2/local_installers/cuda_9.2.148_396.37_linux
patch1: wget https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/9.2/Prod2/patches/1/cuda_9.2.148.1_linux
#select No for installing nvidia driver
sudo sh cuda_9.2.148_396.37_linux
#install patch
sudo sh cuda_9.2.148.1_linux
To configure the CUDA environment for all users (and applications) on your system create the file (use sudo and a text editor of your choice)
/etc/profile.d/cuda.sh
with the following content,
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/cuda/bin
export CUDADIR=/usr/local/cuda
Also create the file,
/etc/ld.so.conf.d/cuda.conf
and add the line,
/usr/local/cuda/lib64
Then run
sudo ldconfig

#test out install by building the samples
cd /home/pcml-user/NVIDIA_CUDA-9.2_Samples
make -j4

#restart machine and test sample
cd  /home/pcml-user/NVIDIA_CUDA-9.2_Samples/bin/x86_64/linux/release/
./nbody -benchmark -numbodies=3 -compare
Run “nbody -benchmark [-numbodies=<numBodies>]” to measure performance.
	-fullscreen       (run n-body simulation in fullscreen mode)
	-fp64             (use double precision floating point values for simulation)
	-hostmem          (stores simulation data in host memory)
	-benchmark        (run benchmark to measure performance)
	-numbodies=<N>    (number of bodies (>= 1) to run in simulation)
	-device=<d>       (where d=0,1,2.... for the CUDA device to use)
	-numdevices=<i>   (where i=(number of CUDA devices > 0) to use for simulation)
	-compare          (compares simulation results running once on the default GPU and once on the CPU)
	-cpu              (run n-body simulation on the CPU)
	-tipsy=<file.bin> (load a tipsy model file for simulation)

NOTE: The CUDA Samples are not meant for performance measurements. Results may vary when GPU Boost is enabled.

GPU Device 0: “Tesla K80" with compute capability 3.7

> Compute 3.7 CUDA device: [Tesla K80]
Warning: “number of bodies” specified 3 is not a multiple of 256.
Rounding up to the nearest multiple: 256.
256 bodies, total time for 10 iterations: 0.385 ms
= 1.703 billion interactions per second
= 34.051 single-precision GFLOP/s at 20 flops per interaction

2)install docker
instructions: https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce-1
add user to docker group so it doesn't have to be run from sudo:
 - sudo gpasswd -a pcml-user docker
 - newgrp docker
